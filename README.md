## kscope -- a p5.js kaleidoscope

Code to run [kscope](http://montaukedp.com/apps/kscope/).

kscope started life as a Java Swing application.  Really.  Then, it was a Processing and processing.js sketch (the pde is included in the projects js folder).  It's latest--and first public--incarnation is as a [p5.js](http://p5js.org/) application.
